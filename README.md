# Ladder viewangles calculator

Almost everyone knows the standard trick to maximising ladder climbing speed. However, it is not obvious what the optimal viewangles for climbing slanted ladders are. Even though slanted ladders are extremely rare in vanilla Half-Life games, it can appear in mods or custom maps.

For TASes of these custom games, we need to be able to calculate the optimal viewangles so that we do not lose time unnecessarily. You can use this calculator for this purpose.

The main convenience of this calculator is the ability to automatically spit out the correct viewangles given your strafing directions. This is important because the optimal viewangles are different if you decide to execute `+forward` and `+moveleft` to climb up a ladder, or to execute `+back` and `+moveright` to climb up the same ladder.

Do note that the choices you make in strafing directions do not affect the maximum climbing speed. So climbing with `+moveright` is not any faster than climbing with `+moveleft`, for example.
